## System Implementation:

- Java is the main programming language supported by Android and is used throughout the development of this application.

- XML is generally used to manipulate the layout for each screen involved in the application. The coding standards used shall comply with the type of Android layouts applied on each screen such as Relative Layout, Absolute Layout etc.

- Each and every page is written in Java which is linked with XML that finishes to give a perfect look for every screen in the application.

- Even if the Java classes which serve as activities for the application do not contain any errors, application may fail to be launched as the classes have yet to be initiated or permitted in the manifest XML file of the project. To allow an activity written in a Java class to be  executed by the application, the <activity> tag must be included in the manifest file.

#### AndroidManifest.xml:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
package="com.example.newproject">
<application
android:allowBackup="true"....
